decolumnizer
============

Decolumnize pdf.

Open a multicolumn pdf (most of the time a scientific publication), and output a epub file with no column. Yes, it's a kind of pdf to epub!



Use a slightly modified [web2epub.py](https://github.com/rupeshk/web2epub) to generate epub.



How does it work?
-----------------

pdf ==convert==> image of each page ==decol.py==> images + htmls ==web2epub.py==> epub
